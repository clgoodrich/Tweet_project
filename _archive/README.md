# Archive Folder

This folder contains files that are not needed for the current Hurricane Tweet Analysis project but have been preserved for reference.

## Archive Date
October 27, 2025

## Contents

### 1. legacy_scripts/
**Reason for archiving:** These are old prototype scripts, test files, and superseded implementations.

- `test.py` - Test script referencing external SAOCOM project
- `tester_main.py` - Test/development script
- `main_project.py` - Old 1300+ line monolithic implementation (superseded by modular approach)
- `mosaic_builder.py` - Unconfigured template script
- `build_space_time_cube.py` - Duplicate of ArcPy space-time cube builder

### 2. notebooks/
**Reason for archiving:** Jupyter notebook prototypes used during development.

- `process_v3.ipynb` - Version 3 prototype
- `process_v4.ipynb` - Version 4 prototype
- `to_mosaic.ipynb` - Mosaic creation prototype
- `process_v3.html` - HTML export of v3 notebook

### 3. documentation/
**Reason for archiving:** Project documentation in Word format.

- `tweet project.doc` - Main project documentation
- `tweet project.dotx` - Word template
- `.~lock.tweet project.doc#` - LibreOffice lock file

### 4. ide_settings/
**Reason for archiving:** PyCharm IDE configuration files.

- `.idea/` - Complete PyCharm settings folder

### 5. generated_outputs/
**Reason for archiving:** Generated raster outputs that can be regenerated by running the pipeline.

- `rasters_output/` - Generated tweet rasters for both hurricanes
- `rasters_normalized/` - Normalized raster outputs
- `outputs/` - Additional output products
- `Tweet_project.Overviews/` - ArcGIS overview pyramids (regenerated automatically)

### 6. duplicate_data/
**Reason for archiving:** Duplicate data that was stored inside the geodatabase data folder.

- `gdb_data_folder/` - Complete copy of data that already exists in main `data/` directory
  - Includes duplicate GeoJSON files, shapefiles, and scripts

## Current Project Structure

After cleanup, the main project contains only:
- `main.py` - Entry point
- `src/` - Core Python modules (config, data_loader, geographic_matching, rasterization, arcgis_mosaic, etc.)
- `data/` - Source data (GeoJSON, shapefiles, tables)
- `Tweet_project.gdb/` - ArcGIS geodatabase (cleaned)
- `.venv/` - Virtual environment
- `.git/` - Git repository

## Restoration

If you need any of these files:
1. Files can be copied back from this `_archive/` folder
2. Generated outputs can be recreated by running the pipeline
3. For documentation, refer to the Word documents in `documentation/`

## Notes

- All core functionality remains in the main project directory
- The modular architecture (Main.py + src/ modules) supersedes the old monolithic scripts
- Generated outputs are excluded from git and can be regenerated anytime
